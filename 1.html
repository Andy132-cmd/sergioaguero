<h1>1.Introduction</h1>
Sergio Aguero (born 2 June 1988) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a striker for Premier League club Manchester City and the Argentine national team.
Aguero began his career at Independiente. On 5 July 2003, he became the youngest player to play in the Argentine Primera Division on his debut at 15 years and 35 days, breaking the record previously established by Diego Maradona in 1976. In 2006, he moved to Europe to play for La Liga side Atletico Madrid, for a transfer fee of 23 million euros and made a name for himself, attracting attention from Europe's top clubs by scoring 101 goals in 234 appearances while winning the UEFA Europa League and the UEFA Super Cup in 2010.
Aguero moved to Premier League club Manchester City in July 2011 for an undisclosed fee thought to be in the region of 35 million pound. On the last day of his debut season with the club, he scored a 94th-minute winner against Queens Park Rangers that earned City its first league title in 44 years. At the end of the 2015 16 season, of players who had played at least two seasons in the Premier League, Aguero had the highest goals per minute ratio in the history of the competition since its formation in 1992, averaging a goal every 106 minutes, ahead of Thierry Henry. He also holds the joint record for the most goals scored in a single Premier League match five and the fastest to do so, in 23 minutes and 34 seconds of match time. In November 2017, Aguero became Manchester City's all time highest goal scorer, scoring his 178th City goal against Napoli. Aguero is currently the 6th highest goalscorer in Premier League history, and the highest non European scorer in the history of the Premier League, with 168 goals in the division.
At the international level, Aguero represented the Argentina under-20 team at the FIFA U-20 World Cup in 2005 and in 2007, winning both tournaments. He played at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, scoring two goals in the three nail semi final win against Brazil as Argentina went on to win the gold medal. Aguero was selected to represent the senior team in the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the 2011 Copa America, the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the 2015 Copa America, and the Copa America Centenario, reaching the finals of the latter three tournaments. He also participated in the 2018 FIFA World Cup, where he scored his first and second World Cup goals for Argentina, and the 2019 Copa America, where he won a bronze medal.
He wears "Kun" on his shirt, a childhood nickname based on the title character from the cartoon Kum-Kum.
